Ways to improve:

	- MAKE FUNCTIONS & CLASSES: Definitely need to use a function here instead of line-by-line for customization.
		○ It would be cool to be able to import whatever model a user would want to try. 
		○ But I don't know how to make that work with the imports. Importing everything seems like a bad idea. 

	- FINETUNE MODEL: For Isolation Forest, I didn't even try any of the parameters, since I'm flying blind on whether it's doing a good job of finding outliers or not. It has some params I'd be interested in messing with like contamination. 

	- LEARN DICTS/NP ARRAYS BETTER: I defaulted to pandas dataframes because that's what was more comfortable. I'd like to learn how to use np arrays better just to avoid that extra step of converting to/from dfs. 
    - ADD VISUALIZATIONS: When determining outliers, it would be useful to see a visualization of the data to compare it to the results. 


Team feedback: 
    - IsolationForest should have a number of partitions attribute that you can use to plot performance
    - Taking the norm data from the 512 features should create an easy way to plot data points as well. 
    - Definitely should be using OOP and creating small functions that a team member can easily use.
